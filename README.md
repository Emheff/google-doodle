When I think of balloons I think of a child so excited about having this balloon and in their excitement they forget to hold on and they let it go. I then picture it floating to where ever the wind takes it. Balloons were first evented around the early 1800s. Balloons for many years were made with dried animal bladders, such as a pig bladder. The animal bladders could expand and were not easily broken. They hadn’t invented rubber yet.  Balloons now a day come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and made with different materials. They aren’t just the typical shape that we think of a balloon. Over the years balloons have been used not just for entertainment but for medical treatment, transportation, military defense, and for meteorology. In the entertainment side of balloons they have a bunch of different uses. They can be used for decorating, for making objects, small and large. (Balloon animals) Decorating with balloons has become more elaborate, where hundreds and hundreds of balloons are used for the design. When thinking about balloons you think of celebration. A child's birthday party with filled with balloon and a clown making balloon animals. But balloons are used in more ways than just celebration. We use balloons now for medical purposes. They are something used to help people, even save lives. Balloons are even used for transportation, a hot air balloon. You are able to look at the world from a different perspective. After learning about all that balloons are used for all different things. They are so much more than just simple rubber. They have such a bigger purpose then I think people realize. But with that I can see how much joy an excitement that a balloon can create for a child. Balloons are so much more than rubber filled with air/gas.
